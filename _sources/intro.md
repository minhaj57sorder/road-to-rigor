(Lab Meeting Version)

**What you should already know:**

This unit is for learners who are expected to have already taken 2 to 3 other units and have a broad sense of what is meant by “rigor”, and what rigor solutions might look like. 

**What you will have learned by the end of this:**

1. Describe the breadth and scope of rigor and reproducibility issues in research (with examples).
2. Explain research rigor as a reflective practice.
3. Evaluate different approaches to improving research rigor.
4. Construct your own pathway into improving research practices.
